                    I&apos;m currently working on a project which is for Dota 1 players it&apos;s on PWA form.Its called Dota 1 assistant. I&apos;m also open to new opportunities, so if you&apos;d like to work together, please don&apos;t hesitate to reach out! 
                    <br /><br />
                    As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.I&apos;m also getting into back-end development and learning new technologies.
                    The full stack is the way to go!
                    <br /><br />
                    When I&apos;m not in front of a computer screen, I&apos;m probably out for a stroll to bring some new ideas into the game, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
